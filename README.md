This is a test of HTML and CSS knowledge. The goal is to re-create the design given in both desktop and mobile view to ensure a responsive design.

You can view my solution at the live site below as well as the 'challenge' specification below it to compare the two.

I re-created this design by eye without any software like Figma. This increases the difficulty and time it takes to re-create a layout as opposed to having all the values in front of you like font sizes, margins, etc.
